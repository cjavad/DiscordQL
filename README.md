You ever wanted to browse your discord server from a terminal? Look no further discordquery aims to be a CLI interface with your discord bot.

Discordquery provides a SQL-like query language that interacts with discord.js (our discord api library) and in turn your discord bot.

## Roadmap

[ ] Custom output formatter for the interactive mode (a json config or something similar)

[ ] Refractor code, document api / project and fix code commands (code quality)

[ ] Implement permission management, channel management and member management.
